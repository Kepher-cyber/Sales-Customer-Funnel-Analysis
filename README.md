# Sales-Customer-Funnel-Analysis
Analysis on sales and undestanding of customer funnels in different regions. 
# Project Background
As a data analyst at a fast-growing e-commerce company that has been operating for several years using the Shopify platform, I led a project aimed at leveraging Power BI to analyze sales data. The company operates within the online retail industry, and its business model revolves around direct-to-consumer transactions. With a growing customer base and increasing transaction volumes, we focused on key metrics such as average order value, repeat purchase rates, and customer lifetime value.

The core objective of this project was to design an interactive Power BI dashboard that would translate raw transactional data into actionable insights. This included identifying trends in revenue growth, understanding customer purchasing behavior, and tracking customer retention over time. These insights are now used by stakeholders across marketing, sales, and product teams to drive strategic decisions and optimize customer engagement efforts

# Executive Summary
## Overview and Findings
Over the course of one week, our Shopify sales data revealed three key insights: First, the business generated over $4.1M in net sales, with an impressive average order value of $526.60, largely driven by the strong performance of running shoes, which alone accounted for $1.4M in sales. Second, nearly half (46%) of our 4,431 customers were repeat buyers, reflecting a solid customer retention rate and a promising lifetime value of $943.60. Lastly, Shopify Payments was the preferred payment method (58%), and Washington emerged as our top-performing state in both sales and customer volume, signaling strong regional brand traction. 
## Insights Deep Dive
### Category 1: Transaction Performance
**Main Insight 1: Strong Net Sales Performance**
The store generated a total of $4,180,474 in net sales over just one week, reflecting a high revenue-generating capability in a short time frame. This performance points to a healthy demand environment and effective sales conversions, especially given the context of e-commerce. A significant portion of these sales was driven by running shoes, which alone contributed $1.4 million, accounting for approximately 33% of total net sales—highlighting a standout product segment worth continued promotion or inventory investment.

**Main Insight 2: High Average Order Value (AOV)**
The Net Average Order Value (AOV) for the week was $526.60, indicating that customers are making high-value purchases per transaction. This suggests a focus on premium or bundled offerings and signals an opportunity to double down on upselling or cross-selling strategies. The high AOV also implies that even with a modest number of transactions, significant revenue can be generated, reinforcing the importance of optimizing the product mix and promotional offers to maintain or increase this value.

**Main Insight 3: Healthy Sales Volume**
The business recorded a total sales quantity of 7,534 units during the week. This strong unit volume, when viewed alongside the high AOV, suggests both high-value and high-quantity sales are contributing to performance. It also indicates a balanced demand across different SKUs, although a deeper product-level analysis would help identify inventory risk or sales concentration. Tracking unit volume in relation to promotional periods could help distinguish whether this spike is seasonal or sustainable.

**Main Insight 4: Payment Preferences Favor Shopify Payments**
In terms of transaction methods, Shopify Payments emerged as the most preferred method, accounting for 58% of all transactions, followed by PayPal. This insight is important for optimizing checkout flows and understanding customer trust in different platforms. It may also have implications on transaction fees and settlement times, which affect operational cash flow. Knowing customer preferences in payment can guide future decisions about which options to promote or simplify at checkout to reduce cart abandonment.

### Category 2: Customer Purchase Behavior
**Main Insight 1: Balanced Mix of New and Returning Customers**
Out of a total of 4,431 customers in the one-week period, 2,392 were single-order customers while 2,039 were repeat customers. This indicates that 46% of the customer base placed more than one order, showing a strong inclination toward brand loyalty and customer satisfaction. The near 50/50 split between new and returning customers suggests the brand is successfully acquiring new customers while also retaining a significant portion of its existing base—an ideal scenario for long-term growth.

**Main Insight 2: Encouraging Repeat Rate**
The repeat purchase rate stands at 46%, which is high for an e-commerce platform over a one-week window. This suggests that nearly half of the customers are engaged enough to come back for additional purchases shortly after their first transaction. This behavior could be attributed to effective post-purchase engagement strategies, strong product satisfaction, or ongoing promotional efforts. It also presents an opportunity to launch targeted loyalty or subscription programs to further boost retention.

**Main Insight 3: Modest Purchase Frequency with Room for Growth**
The purchase frequency was recorded at 1.68, meaning on average, customers made close to two purchases within the week. While this is a healthy figure, it also indicates there’s room to grow recurring behavior through strategies like limited-time offers, cart abandonment follow-ups, or product recommendations based on previous purchases. Increasing this frequency, even slightly, could have a significant compounding effect on overall revenue and customer lifetime value.

**Main Insight 4: High-Value Customer Base**
The Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) for the week was $943.60, suggesting that on average, each customer brings in nearly $1,000 in revenue. For a one-week timeframe, this is exceptionally high and reflects either a high-priced product mix, strong retention strategies, or highly effective customer targeting. This figure justifies investment in customer acquisition and retention efforts, as each retained customer contributes significantly to long-term profitability. It also points to the potential impact of even small increases in retention or purchase frequency.

### Category 3: Retention and Value KPIs
**Main Insight 1: Impressive Repeat Rate Suggests Strong Brand Stickiness**
With a 46% repeat customer rate, the data reveals a strong tendency for customers to return after their first purchase. In e-commerce, a repeat rate near 50% is exceptional, especially within such a short timeframe. This suggests high levels of satisfaction with the product or service, trust in the brand, and effective post-purchase engagement strategies. Capitalizing on this trend through targeted re-engagement campaigns or loyalty rewards could further boost customer retention and overall profitability.

**Main Insight 2: Purchase Frequency Points to Growth Opportunities**
The purchase frequency of 1.68 indicates that customers are making slightly more than one purchase per week on average. While this is encouraging, especially in non-subscription e-commerce, it also highlights a clear opportunity for improvement. Introducing personalized marketing, time-sensitive promotions, or product bundling strategies could nudge this number higher. Even a modest increase in purchase frequency could yield significant returns when applied across a growing customer base.

**Main Insight 3: Strong Geographic Concentration in Washington**
The City of Washington stood out as the top-performing region in terms of net sales, repeat customers and total customers. This indicates a regional customer base that is not only large but likely more loyal or better targeted by marketing efforts. Doubling down on campaigns in this region—or analyzing what’s working there—could inform strategies to replicate similar success in other states.

## Recommendations to Stakeholder Team
**Observation:** Running shoes generated the highest sales, accounting for $1.4M in net revenue during the week.
